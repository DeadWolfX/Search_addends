<h2>Project description</h2>
<p>This project provides a Jupyter Lab notebook that addresses a problem based on invoices, which consists of:</p><br>
<p>Given a finite set of $N$ quantities $\mathcal{S}=\{s_1,s_2,...,s_3\}$ and a single quantitie $S$, we want to find a subset $\mathcal{T}\subset\mathcal{S}$
such that <br>
  $$\sum_{t_i\in\mathcal{T}}t_i=S$$ <br>
</p>
